# Shock-Box-2021
The Shock Box is a randomized shocking device that has a 4 in 5 chance of delivering a shock to the user.  The device uses a tingler kit to deliver the shock.  An Arduino Uno and a relay control the tingler kit.  The device accepts 9vdc input from the 9v battery connector on the back of the box.  The conducting pads for the tingler kit are located on the front of the box.
